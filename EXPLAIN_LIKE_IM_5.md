# The Magic Piggy Bank 🐷✨

## What is This Project?

Imagine you have a **magic piggy bank** that does three cool things:

### 1. 🏦 It Grows Your Money
When you put your coins in the piggy bank, the piggy bank is **super smart**! It takes most of your coins and gives them to a **friendly robot** who knows how to make more coins. The robot goes to work and comes back with **extra coins** for you!

### 2. 💰 You Can Share It With Friends
When you put coins in, you get a special **sticker** (we call it a "share"). The more coins you put in, the more stickers you get! Later, when you want your coins back, you trade your stickers for coins - and guess what? You get **MORE coins** than you put in because the robot made them grow! 🌱

### 3. 🤝 Friends Can Borrow Coins
If your friend needs to borrow some coins, they can ask the piggy bank! But here's the rule: they have to give back a little extra (like 10% more). That extra goes into the piggy bank to help everyone's coins grow even faster!

### 💎 Special Coins (WETH)

## How Does It Work?

### Story Time! 📖

**Chapter 1: You Put Coins In**
```
You: "Here's 10 coins, magic piggy bank!"
Piggy Bank: "Thanks! Here are 10 stickers for you!"
Piggy Bank: "Robot, take 9 coins and make them grow!"
Piggy Bank: "I'll keep 1 coin here just in case someone needs it quickly."
Robot: "Got it! Off to work I go!" 🏃‍♂️
```

**Chapter 2: The Robot Works Hard**
```
Robot: *works really hard*
Robot: "I made the 9 coins grow to 9.45 coins!" (5% more!)
Piggy Bank: "Wow! Now we have 10.45 coins total!"
```

**Chapter 3: You Want Your Coins Back**
```
You: "I want my coins back! Here are my 10 stickers."
Piggy Bank: "Let me check... You have 10 stickers out of 10 total stickers."
Piggy Bank: "That means you own ALL the coins!"
Piggy Bank: "Here's 10.45 coins! You made 0.45 extra coins!" 🎉
You: "Yay! My coins grew!"
```

**Chapter 4: Your Friend Borrows**
```
Friend: "Can I borrow 3 coins?"
Piggy Bank: "Sure! But you have to give back 3.3 coins (10% extra)."
Friend: "Okay!" *takes 3 coins*
Friend: *uses coins for something cool*
Friend: "Here's 3.3 coins back!"
Piggy Bank: "Thanks! That extra 0.3 coins helps everyone!" 💰
```

## The Magic Rules ✨

### Rule 1: Stickers = Ownership
The more stickers (shares) you have, the more of the piggy bank you own!

### Rule 2: Everyone Shares the Growth
When the robot makes coins grow, EVERYONE with stickers gets richer!

### Rule 3: Borrowing Costs Extra
If you borrow, you pay a little extra. That's fair because you're using other people's coins!

### Rule 4: The Robot Needs Help
Sometimes we need to give the robot extra coins so it can give us the growth. It's like feeding your pet so it can play with you! 🐕

## Fun Examples!

### Example 1: The Lemonade Stand 🍋

Imagine three friends:
- **Alice** puts in 10 coins
- **Bob** puts in 5 coins  
- **Charlie** puts in 5 coins

Total: 20 coins in the piggy bank!

The robot makes them grow by 10%:
- Now there are 22 coins total!

When they take their coins back:
- **Alice** gets 11 coins (she put in half, so she gets half of 22)
- **Bob** gets 5.5 coins
- **Charlie** gets 5.5 coins

Everyone made money! 🎊

### Example 2: The Borrower 💸

**David** wants to borrow 4 coins to buy a toy:
- He borrows 4 coins
- He has to pay back 4.4 coins (10% extra)
- He uses the 4 coins to buy a toy and sell it for 5 coins
- He pays back 4.4 coins
- He keeps 0.6 coins as profit!
- The piggy bank keeps the 0.4 extra coins to share with everyone!

Everybody wins! 🏆

## Why Is This Cool?

### 🔒 It's Safe
The piggy bank is made of super strong magic (smart contracts) that nobody can break into!

### 🤖 It's Automatic
You don't have to do anything! The robot does all the hard work!

### 📈 You Make Money While You Sleep
Put your coins in, go play, come back later, and you have MORE coins!

## The Special Computer Magic 💻

This piggy bank isn't a real piggy bank - it's made of **computer code**! 

Think of it like this:
- Instead of a real piggy bank, it's a **smart contract** (a robot program on the computer)
- Instead of real coins, we use **cryptocurrency** (digital money)
- Instead of a real robot, we have **code** that automatically invests money
- Instead of stickers, we have **shares** (digital stickers!)

But it works EXACTLY like our story! ✨
